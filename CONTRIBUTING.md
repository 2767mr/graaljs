## Contributing

Thanks for considering to contribute your changes to the Graal/JavaScript project.
We are grateful for your support, as it helps us to maintain and improve the high-performance JavaScript engine on top of Java.

Please fork our repository and experiment with it.
There are many directions to explore from smaller changes like bug fixes or improvements to the repository's documentation to larger changes that either speed execution up, implement new features, improve the tooling, or give better control over the system.
Once you believe your contribution is valuable for others, create a pull request.
Please make sure to include a clear description of the intention of the change.

## Workflow

We do have a comprehensive CI system internally.
All incoming pull requests will be evaluated there.
Once all tests are passing, we can merge the pull request.

We are striving to make the CI system available in the future, so contributors can evaluate the code themselves.

## Oracle Contributor Agreement

There is a white-list for contributors who have signed the OCA, determined by e-mail address.
The process is fully automated if you provide the same e-mail address on your OCA and in your github profile.
Please add a comment to your first pull request indicating the name you used to sign the OCA if it isn't clear from your github profile and you cannot use the identical e-mail address.
